The GIF Search app built using React allows users to search for GIFs and displays the results using the Giphy API. It also includes the following additional features:

## Favorite Feature:

Users can mark their favorite GIFs by clicking on a "Favorite" button/icon associated with each GIF in the search results.
Marked favorite GIFs are stored persistently, allowing users to access them even after leaving the page or closing the app.

## Trending Feature:

The app showcases a curated list of trending GIFs fetched in real-time from the Giphy API.
Users can explore the most popular and up-to-date GIFs across various categories.
These features enhance user engagement and make the GIF Search app more enjoyable and personalized for users.
